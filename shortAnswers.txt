What is source code?
    the code that a computer runs to create an application.
What makes computers so “smart”, anyway?
    Computers are not smart. they can only do what you tell them. 
    they are campaple of processing complex algorithems very quickly.
What is the purpose of a programming language?
    It's an interpreter between us and the computer or, 
    a luanguage that we can use that the computer also understands.
What are 3 examples of programming languages? Why are there so many of these?
    Python, JavaScript, C++. they all have different strengths and weaknesses.
What is a variable? Why are variables useful?
    A location in memory. we tell the computer what that location holds 
    so that we can access it whenever we need.
What is the difference between a single-equals (=) and a double-equals (==)?
    = sets a veriable, == determines equality
What is the difference between a double-equals (==) and a triple-equals (===)?
    == considers generally equality without considering type
    === considers the type of the variable
Why does the developer console exist?
    It's a place where we can create, debug and test our apps
When we talk about “conditional” statements, what does that mean? What is an example?
    if/else statments are conditional. if this do that, if that do this. 
    The computer will run code based on the conditions that we set.
    if(x < y){
        x++
    }
Why would we want FOR or WHILE loops in our source code?
    For and while loops are how computers read lists.
    A computer needs to be told how to read a list and we do this with loops
What is a function? Why would we use functions?
    A function is code that we can call on at anytime.
    It's like a variable only more complex. Like an algorithm that we could use over and over.
How many values can you receive back from a function? How many values can you send in?
    you can console log as many values as you want, but a function will only return one value.
    You can give a function as many parameters as you need.
What is an array? How many values does it hold?
    An array is a list of objects held in memory. it can be as long as it needs to be.
What is a T-diagram and why should I know how to use one?
    It is a hand written method used for solving complex functions or algorithems
What are the two ways to comment JS code? When would you use one versus the other?
    // short comment
    /* Longer Comment */
